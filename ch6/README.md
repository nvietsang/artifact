## Simulations

There are two attack simulations with IDs (E6.1) and (E6.2) in this folder. The simulation code is intended for those without access to the required hardware (ChipWhisperer Lite).

### [Simulation of PFA with faulted Sbox]
[2 human-minutes + 1 compute-minute + 1MB disk]

Go to [6-3_simfsbox](./6-3_simfsbox/) and follow the README there.

```sh
cd 6-3_simfsbox
```

### [Simulation of PFA with faulted Rcon] 
[2 human-minutes + 1 compute-minute + 1MB disk]

Go to [6-4_simfrcon](./6-4_simfrcon/) and follow the README there.

```sh
cd 6-4_simfrcon
```

## Experiments

There are two experiments with IDs (E6.3) and (E6.4) in this folder. The experimental code is intended for those with access to the required hardware (ChipWhisperer Lite).

### [Simulation of PFA with faulted Sbox]
[2 human-minutes + 10 compute-minute + 33MB disk]

Go to [6-3_expfsbox](./6-3_expfsbox/) and follow the README there.

```sh
cd 6-3_expfsbox
```

### [Simulation of PFA with faulted Rcon] 
[2 human-minutes + 10 compute-minute + 33MB disk]

Go to [6-4_expfrcon](./6-4_expfrcon/) and follow the README there.

```sh
cd 6-4_expfrcon
```
