## Preparation

A prerequisite is that trace datasets (0.6GB when unzipped) must be
downloaded via the following link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FjFFczQPTmH7RAc8PRAfW4qk211svjN0/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FjFFczQPTmH7RAc8PRAfW4qk211svjN0/view?usp=share_link)

Make sure that the downloaded file is unzipped and placed in this folder. The following directory must exist:
```
artifact/ch4/data
```

The data contains 5 datasets for corresponding to 5 different keys, each has 10000 traces. 

## Experiments

There are two experiments with IDs (E4.1) and (E4.2) in this folder.

### [Multi-bit Selection Functions]
[2 human-minutes + 2 compute-hours + 15GB disk]

Go to [4-2_multibits](./4-2_multibits/) and follow the README there.

```sh
cd 4-2_multibits
```

### [Cautionary Notes] 
[2 human-minutes + 1 compute-minute + 50MB disk]

Go to [4-3_notes](./4-3_notes/) and follow the README there.

```sh
cd 4-3_notes
```
